# Open Source Ecosystem on VPS

## Overview
This document outlines our plan to host an ecosystem of open-source applications on a VPS machine. Our aim is to create a cohesive and flexible environment that enables team collaboration, project management, and productivity using a range of open-source software.

## Domain Setup
Each service will be accessible via subdomains of `demo.in`. Below are the planned services and their respective URLs.


## Hosted Services

### 1. **Mail** - Mailcow
   - Purpose: Web mail solution for managing emails.
   - Access: [mail.demo.in](http://mail.demo.in)

### 2. **Messaging** - Signal and Mattermost
   - Purpose: Communication and team messaging platforms.
   - Access: [mattermost.demo.in](http://mattermost.demo.in) (Web) and mobile downloads for iOS/Android.

### 3. **Product Management** - Plane
   - Purpose: Project and task management.
   - Access: [plane.demo.in](http://plane.demo.in)

### 4. **Scheduling** - Cal.com
   - Purpose: Appointment scheduling.
   - Access: [cal.demo.in](http://cal.demo.in)

## Infrastructure & Technology Stack

To manage and deploy these services efficiently, we plan to use the following tools and technologies:

- **Docker**: Containerization of all applications.
- **Coolify**: An open-source Heroku alternative for managing Docker applications.
- **Traefik**: A reverse proxy and load balancer, especially useful for handling traffic across multiple services and ensuring SSL.

We may also integrate additional technologies as needed to enhance the stability, scalability, and security of our ecosystem.

## Additional Notes

- **SSL**: Traefik will handle SSL certificates for secure access to all services.
- **Scalability**: Services will be containerized to simplify scaling and updates.
- **Monitoring & Backups**: Routine monitoring and backups will be set up to ensure data security and minimize downtime.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more collaborative tools as required.
- Improving load balancing and scaling configurations as team activity grows.

This ecosystem will provide an integrated workspace with everything from messaging to project management, secure document storage, and scheduling, enabling our team to work seamlessly and productively.
